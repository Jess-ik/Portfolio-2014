# Portfolio 2014 - Graphic Design

Welcome to the repository of my 2014 portfolio, as a graphic designer. This project originated during my search for internships in the USA, and it became a cornerstone of my early professional experiences.

## Project Overview

This portfolio was crafted to showcase my graphic design skills, acting as a visual narrative of my journey. Its inception coincided with my time at Vokent, a design agency in Malibu, where I had the privilege of interning for 3 months. This experience led to freelance opportunities with renowned brands like Casamigos Tequila. Eventually, I returned to Los Angeles to work as a Junior Designer for the esteemed branding agency, Siegel+Gale, for a fulfilling one-year tenure.
